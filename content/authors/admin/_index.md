Hi, I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~jyotsanak/www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~jyotsanak/www.iitb.ac.in) working with [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya ](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~jyotsanak/www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb).

My research focuses on deep learning techniques for various NLP tasks in low resource scenarios, especially for Indian Languages. I am currently exploring cross-lingual word embeddings and Unsupervised Machine Translation for Indian Languages.
